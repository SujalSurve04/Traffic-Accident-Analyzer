# Traffic Accident Analysis

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors are created using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Required Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Install the required packages using:



## Dataset
The analysis utilizes the "RTA Dataset.csv" dataset, available in the same directory as the Python script.

Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the script file (traffic_accident_analysis.py).
Download the "RTA Dataset.csv" file and place it in the same directory as the script.
Running the Script
Execute the script using the following command:
python traffic_accident_analysis.py
Customization
Additional analysis: Explore other variables in the dataset.
Visualization customization: Adjust parameters in the Matplotlib and Seaborn plots for a more tailored visualization.
Results
The script generates visualizations showcasing the distribution of accidents by day of the week, road surface conditions, and light conditions.
